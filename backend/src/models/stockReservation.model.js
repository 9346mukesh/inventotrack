// Stock reservation is handled via the Product model's reservedStock field
// and the Cart model's timestamps for 15-minute expiry tracking.

// If needed in the future for advanced tracking, implement:
// - StockReservation model to log all reservation/release events
// - Reference in Cart and Order models
// - Audit trail for inventory tracking
